# Section of Research and Exploration

## Status: mostly not working

Build 82834 and the previous couple PTEs changed the way GW tech is handled, which mostly breaks this mod - the only previews you will get are new loadouts.  I've fixed it to keep from breaking things, in the hopes of revisting the strategic layer of the star map once changes settle down again.

## Description

Shows the available tech in the Galactic War system detail panel. This is even more of a cheat than Section of Foreign Intelligence, but I often found myself with four or more systems that I could attack, and very few reasons to choose one over the others. This mod makes that decision more interesting, and adds a new strategic element to your path through the stars.
